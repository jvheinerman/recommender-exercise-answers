## Exercise with the Movielens Dataset



#### Installation

For this exercises we will use Google Colab. As a result, we won't need to install anything locally.

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Once here, go to the GitHub tab and pass the URL of this repository, i.e., https://github.com/jvheinerman/recommender-exercise
Here, you should be able to see a file called DataMining_Practical_Recommender.ipynb. Open it.
3. Unfortunately, Colab does not automatically import the data we need for this exercise, and therefore, we need to do this online. Luckily, this is very easy!

#### Uploading the data

Download this repository and extract it locally in your computer.
In Colab, go to the Bestanden tab (with a folder icon) on the left side of the screen (undernead a key icon). And there select upload.
Upload the files "movies.csv" and "ratings.csv".
Now, you are ready to go!
